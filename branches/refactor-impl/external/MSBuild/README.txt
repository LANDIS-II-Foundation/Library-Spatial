Current stable release: v1.2.0.306

To update the assembly in this folder to a new stable release:

1) Download the new stable release from the URL above, as a Windows
   Installer Package (MSBuild.Community.Tasks.msi), into the folder
   with this README file.
   
2) Run the unpack+copy_files.cmd script by double clicking it.  The
   script will unpack the *.msi file into a subfolder, and then copy
   the necessary *.dll files from that subfolder to this folder.
